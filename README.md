# An Abstract Adventure

Welcome to An Abstract Adventure, a 2d platformer in a world of shapes! Play through 2 intersecting stories, as the Knight Sir. Kall, and the Rebel Que Lee. Go on a journey to save the cities of Bulbridge and New Polymore, in one story collecting elemental runes to stop an approaching darkness, and in the other leading the charge towards overthrowing a corrupt government that's hypnotizing its citizens!
