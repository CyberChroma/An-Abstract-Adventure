# An Abstract Adventure

Welcome to An Abstract Adventure, a 2.5d platformer in a world of shape creatures! Play as 2 characters, a cube and sphere, each with different abilities! Both characters exist in a level at the same time, and you switch between them in real time to get through levels! Go on a journey to save the cities of Bulbridge and New Polymore, collecting elemental runes to stop an approaching darkness, the Atraments, from destroying the world!


Basic Story:

2 planets on opposite sides of a star. A cube world with the city of New Polymore, futuristic and sci-fi, and a sphere world with the kingdom of Blulbridge, with magic and fantasy creatures. Dark creatures, the Atraments are causing the worlds to phase into each other, which will eventually destroy both worlds. The 2 main characters become able to see and interact with both worlds, and must work together to stop the Atraments. Long ago, 4 elemental runes were used to seal the Atraments away, but they have disappeared, and our heroes must find and reassemble them before it's too late.

Game Flow:

In a level, both characters exist at the same time. The screen shows a horizontal split screen view, where the top camera follows the cube character Que, and the bottom camera follows the sphere character Kall. Both characters move through the same level, but parallel versions of it.

Characters start in the hub world of both cities. After some story or short cutscenes, they must explore the area, like a minilevel in itself. They come across a level entrance, which will stand out. When they touch the level entrance, UI will pop up allowing them to select a mission. This will be laid out like a constellation or path that splits and rejoins at different parts. They select a mission and go into the level. Each mission of a level uses the same environment in a different state and has the player explore different parts of it. They will have some objective to complete, such as collecting something or getting to an area, that may have multiple sub objectives within it, like coming across a locked door, and now a key must be found. After beating the mission, the player is brought back to the mission select, where one or multiple new missions will be unlocked. They can select a new mission or go back to the hub. Some missions can be played out of order, but eventually all must be beaten to finish area, usually ending with some big story segment, which will automatically bring the player back to the hub, which will also be in a different state to unlock the next level in the hub. Each level should have 5 missions, the last of which will be a boss for some levels.
